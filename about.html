        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            We are a group of 8 all united by our love and passion for making the most memorable day in every couple's day even more special.
            <br>We started as a general decoration company a few ago but we soon reliased that our passion was about wedding days and everything
            <br>that goes with it hence we decided to concentrate our energy and time to wedding decoration exclusively.
        </p>
        <p>After many years of providing our service as a wedding decoration company, 5 years ago we turned our attention to an even more
            <br>important aspect of the wedding, dressing the newlyweds along with the bridemaids and bestmen.

                    <br> to the wedding boutique and I got to say I was impressed by the level of professionalism with which they offer their
                    <br> services, we sent an email out with our requirements and they replied the sameday and set up an appointment within
                    <br> a week and when we met they had reviewed our requirements and came up with options for venues, catring services,
                    <br> dressing and even things we didn't include in our initial request for service. They promised to make our day more
                    <br>special and memorable and they did. I would recommend their services to anyone without hesitating for a second.
                </p>
                <p>from TWB: thanks alot Mr. and Mrs. Charles glad we were able to make your special day grander and memeorable.</p>

                    <br>weeks to put a plan together and execute it. Something that many companies in the same industry could not do with
                    <br> months of preparation.

                <p>
